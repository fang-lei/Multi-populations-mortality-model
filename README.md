# Multi-populations Mortality Model (MuPMoMo)

A study of multi-population mortatlity models. We aggregate 
mortality data from a large number of countries over a large 
number of years in order to try to "predict" China's population
evolution over the next 10 to 20 years.

The data used is from the HMD database at http://www.mortality.org/.
After cloning this repository, users can reproduce our results by registering

their local copy and run the code as follows:
